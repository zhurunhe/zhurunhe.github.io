I am an Assistant Professor in the Moss School of Construction, Infrastructure and Sustainability at Florida International University (FIU). I earned my Ph.D. in Civil Engineering from the University of Southern California (USC). I also received M.S. degrees in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering from USC. Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Construction Management from Tianjin University, China.    


My research primarily focuses on the intersection of humans and built environments. I am interested in understanding how humans interact with built environments in different scenarios and at varying levels. With empirical studies using tools such as virtual and augmented reality, physiological sensing, computer simulations, and artificial intelligence, I aim to enhance human safety, productivity and wellness, and facilitate the transition toward more sustainable and resilient built environments and communities.
