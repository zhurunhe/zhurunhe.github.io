I am an Assistant Professor in the Moss School of Construction, Infrastructure and Sustainability at Florida International University. I obtained my Ph.D. in Civil Engineering from the University of Southern California, where I also earned M.S. degrees in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. Additionally, I hold a Bachelor's degree in Construction Management from Tianjin University, China.  


My research primarily focuses on the intersection of humans and built environments. My research aims to understand how people interact with built environments in various scenarios and at different levels. By conducting empirical studies using tools such as virtual and augmented reality, physiological sensing, computer simulations, and artificial intelligence, my goal is to improve human safety, productivity, and wellness, while also facilitating the transition toward sustainable and resilient built environments and communities.
